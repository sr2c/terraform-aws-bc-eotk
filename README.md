Terraform module to deploy Bypass Censorship Enterprise Onion Toolkit instances in AWS.

This module supports creating multiple EC2 instances, each serving the same selection of onion services. Due to the
way that onion services are published, this provides basic load balancing and failover, although there is no direct
coordination between the EOTK instances.

Each EC2 instance is deployed to a separate availability zone (up to a maximum number of the number of available
availability zones within the region).

The nginx reverse proxy server configured by EOTK on each instance will keep access logs and these will be rotated
hourly. On rotation, the logs will be copied to an S3 bucket for processing by an analytics system.

Rather than replace the EC2 instance on every update, which would be difficult given that EOTK builds tor and
OpenResty from source as part of the installation process (time consuming), a script is installed to reconfigure
EOTK every 25 minutes with any updated configuration bundle uploaded to the S3 bucket. The EC2 instances should
still be considered "disposable" however, as new AMIs will cause EC2 instance replacement.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


Before the module may be used, a zip file containing the EOTK configuration and the necessary Onion and TLS keys
and certificates must be created. This may be done with
[archive_file](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/archive/latest/docs/data-sources/archive_file) or
with a tool like [deterministic-zip](https://github.com/timo-reymann/deterministic-zip) if it is acceptable to have
a non-Terraform solution for that part. No directory structure is used within the zip file, it has only a flat
structure. To begin, create a file named `sites.conf` that contains your EOTK configuration, for example:

```
set log_separate 1

set nginx_resolver 127.0.0.53 ipv6=off  # The EC2 instance will have systemd-resolved

set nginx_cache_seconds 60  # Handle bursts, but don't cache anything too long
set nginx_cache_size 64m
set nginx_tmpfile_size 8m

set x_from_onion_value 1

foreignmap facebookwkhpilnemxj7asaniu7vnjjbiltxjqhye3mhbshg7kx5tfyd.onion facebook.com
foreignmap twitter3e4tixl4xyajtrzo62zg5vztmjuricljdp2c5kshju4avyoid.onion twitter.com

set project sites

hardmap systems3hwkxej5nzmo6kvwgx6sik2plqe4w3lsqglr6xhvyi2xlsmqd test.sr2.uk
```

For each onion service, you'll need to include 4 more files in the zip file:

* `<onion address without .onion>.v3sec.key` - Onion secret key
* `<onion address without .onion>.v3pub.key` - Onion public key
* `<first 20 characters of onion address>-v3.pem` - TLS private key (PEM encoded)
* `<first 20 characters of onion address>-v3.cert` - TLS certificate (PEM encoded)

For the example given above, these files would be named:

* `systems3hwkxej5nzmo6kvwgx6sik2plqe4w3lsqglr6xhvyi2xlsmqd.v3sec.key` - Onion secret key
* `systems3hwkxej5nzmo6kvwgx6sik2plqe4w3lsqglr6xhvyi2xlsmqd.v3pub.key` - Onion public key
* `systems3hwkxej5nzmo6-v3.cert` - TLS private key (PEM encoded)
* `systems3hwkxej5nzmo6-v3.pem` - TLS certificate (PEM encoded)

You can then use the module to create EC2 instances and other resources to run EOTK and serve the onion site:

```hcl
module "eotk" {
  source               = "sr2c/bc-eotk/aws"
  namespace            = "eg"
  name                 = "bc-eotk"
  instance_count       = 1
  configuration_bundle = "configuration.zip"
}
```
